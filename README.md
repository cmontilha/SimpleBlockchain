# SimpleBlockchain

## üéØ Project Purpose

This project was developed with the intention of starting my learning journey in blockchain technology. Although it is a simple example, it covers the fundamental concepts such as transaction management, proof of work mining, and interaction with a basic API. The goal is to build a solid understanding of how blockchains work at their core, which will allow for future expansion and more advanced features.

---

## üìù Features

- **Transaction Management:** Manage basic transactions within the blockchain.
- **Proof of Work Mining:** Includes a simplified proof of work algorithm for mining new blocks.
- **API Integration:** A basic API built with Flask for interacting with the blockchain.  
- **Postman Testing:** API tested and demonstrated using Postman to interact with the endpoints.

---

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Start the Blockchain API:**  
   Run the Python script to launch the blockchain server. This will expose endpoints to interact with the blockchain and manage transactions.
   
2. **Interact with the Blockchain:**  
   Use Postman to test and interact with the following API endpoints:
   - Add new transactions
   - Mine blocks
   - View the current state of the blockchain

## API Interaction

Below is a screenshot of the app in action, showing the API response for blockchain data:

## üí° Inspiration

This project was inspired by various tutorials and resources on blockchain technology, including:
- [Flask API for Beginners by Real Python](https://realpython.com/flask-connexion-rest-api/)
- [Official Flask Documentation (3.0.x)](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) (for API integration and routing)
- [Building a Blockchain from Scratch with Python by Pythoneers on Medium](https://medium.com/pythoneers/building-a-blockchain-from-scratch-with-python-489e7116142e)
- [Build Your Own Blockchain in Python by Hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46)


  
These resources helped guide the implementation of core blockchain features like transaction management, proof of work mining, and creating a simple API.
